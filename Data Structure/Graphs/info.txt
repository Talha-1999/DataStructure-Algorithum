1: A Graphs G=(V,E) is a collection of vertices/Nodes and edges connectiong these points.
2: Used to model paths in a city ,social networks,website backlinks,internal employee
   network etc.
3: A vertex or node is one fundamental unit/entity of which graph are formed.
4: An edge is uniquely defined by its 2 endpoints.
5: Directed Edge - One way Connection.
6: Undirected Edge - Two way Connection.
7: Directed Graph - All directed edges.
8: Undirected Graphs - All Undirected Edges.

Indegree & Outdegree of a Node:

1 : Indegree = No of edges going out of the node.
2 : Outdegree = No of edges coming into the node.
